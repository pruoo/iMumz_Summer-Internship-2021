1. Attach a pubspec.yaml file from one of your past flutter projects.
A) Added file to "technical" folder.

2. What is your understanding of the term “State Management” when talking about Flutter App Development. Explain it in your own words.
A) Honestly, It's not as complicated as people think it to be. To answer on how to manage this, Let's first understand what's exactly 'state'.

You can imagine state of an app as the output of that app/widget on the basis of some particular data, or a variable let's suppose. For example, In case someone tries to open your app and you want to display a login page to the user, in case they aren't logged in and display a dashboard instead, when they are logged in. Here the boolean condition whether a user is logged in or not can be referred to as state of that widget.


Efficiently managing multiple 'state variables' in an app, is known as state management. In flutter, we have a lot of options using which we can manage state including Stateful Widget, Streams, NotificationListener etc.

Also, there are lots of 3rd party packages developed by people in flutter community that help in managing state in their own opinionated ways. For example : Provider, Riverpod, BLOC, mobx etc.

3. When/Where do you usually encounter bugs in your development process?
A) Recently, I've been encountering bugs after addition of null safety in dart, a lot of times many older packages that I worked with previosuly haven't been migrated to null safety, but It gives me the opportunity to contribute to the community by helping those package maintainers to migrate to null safety.
